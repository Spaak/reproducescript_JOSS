This repo is for working on a submission of the reproducescript project for JOSS. 

The submission requirements can be found here: https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html 
To recap, this is required for submission (paper length 250-1000 words):
- The software must be open source as per the OSI definition.
- The software must have an obvious research application.
- You must be a major contributor to the software you are submitting, and have a GitHub account to participate in the review process.
- Your paper must not focus on new research results accomplished with the software.
- Your paper (paper.md and BibTeX files, plus any figures) must be hosted in a Git-based repository together with your software (although they may be in a short-lived branch which is never merged with the default).

In addition, the software associated with your submission must:
- Be stored in a repository that can be cloned without registration.
- Be stored in a repository that is browsable online without registration.
- Have an issue tracker that is readable without registration.
- Permit individuals to create issues/file tickets against your repository.
